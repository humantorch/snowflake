# Snowflake

### This is still very much a work in progress and is not "officially" official. Yet.

Snowflake is Thrillworks' tool for planning and supporting our employees career development, heavily influenced from Medium's career growth framework but I'm in the process of hacking it like it's attacking my family.

## Installation
Get yarn if you donâ€™t have it already:

`npm install -g yarn`

Install dependencies:

`yarn`

### Running the dev server

`yarn dev`

### Building

`yarn export`

This will put a static version of the site in `out/`.
